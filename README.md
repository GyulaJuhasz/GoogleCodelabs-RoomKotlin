# GoogleCodelabs-RoomKotlin

This repository contains the code I created when going through this codelab: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin/

After finishing the codelab's steps, I experimented a little more with the code. I achieved the following results:

* Fixed crash when trying to insert already existing word
* Prevented the loss of user-provided words at every application restart
* Removed unnecessary code resources
* Enabled data binding to make the code more compact
